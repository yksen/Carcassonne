# Carcassonne

This project is a Carcassonne board game implementation written only in Python.

Rules are exactly the same as in the original game 
(for the rules check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#Gameplay).  
The game is playable in a hotseat mode for 2 - 4 players.

Game is entirely controlled by the mouse, specifically: 
- Left mouse button is used to place the tiles as well as the meeples.
- Right mouse button is used to rotate tiles.

Sample game in progress:
